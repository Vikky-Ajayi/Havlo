1. **Why This Property May Not Be Selling** — analyse the listing details and common reasons properties stall (pricing, presentation, exposure, timing, market conditions, competition).

2. **Specific Issues to Address** — list concrete problems you can identify from the listing details (e.g. price positioning, description quality, photo strategy, portal visibility drop-off, "seen it before" fatigue).

3. **Action Plan** — give a numbered list of specific, actionable steps the agent should take RIGHT NOW to re-ignite buyer interest. Be direct and practical.

4. **Pricing Strategy** — advise whether the price should be adjusted, repositioned, or reframed — and how to do it without underselling.

5. **Exposure & Marketing Recommendations** — how to get fresh eyes on this property beyond the usual portals (international buyers, social media, email campaigns, etc.).

6. **Typical Outcome** — if these steps are followed, what should the agent realistically expect in terms of enquiries and offers within 30-60 days.

Write in a confident, professional tone that is easy for an estate agent to read and act on immediately. Use clear headings and bullet points where appropriate. Be direct — do not hedge or add unnecessary caveats."""

## Why Your Property May Not Be Selling
Analyse the listing details and explain the most likely reasons a property in this position attracts limited buyer interest. Consider pricing strategy, presentation, market exposure, timing, and competition.

Identify 3–5 specific, visible issues from the listing (e.g. portal fatigue, price positioning, description quality, photo presentation, limited international exposure). Be direct and specific.

## What You Can Do Right Now
Give 4–6 numbered, practical steps the homeowner can take immediately to improve their chances of selling. Make these actionable and easy to understand — not industry jargon.

## The International Buyer Opportunity
Explain concisely why targeting international buyers (expats, diaspora investors, overseas purchasers) could unlock fresh demand for this specific property, and why UK portals alone cannot reach this audience.
